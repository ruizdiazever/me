            <p>Hello! I am Ever. I became a web developer because i love solving complex 
                problems and I want to make a difference.
                <br><br>
                I am currently based in Rome but i was born and bred in Buenos Aires.
                <br><br>
                Although my professional path has taken twists and turns, I have always 
                nurtured my deep passion in computer science. I become a self-taught
                HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap and Java mobile programming in Android at the 
                age of 24.
                <br><br>
                Soon after, I shifted my interests to web development and I met PYTHON. 
                This is how my never ending love with DJANGO started.
                <br><br>
                I have done work on all sorts of web projects ranging from software 
                development and mobile app creation to front-end/back-end web design 
                and development and database/server management.
                <br><br>
                Curious by nature and eager to develop new skills, I always find the 
                time to keep myself up-to-date with the latest technologies. I am currently 
                studying DOCKER and increasing my expertise on JavaSript.
                <br><br>
                In 2017, I participated to the competition “Plan your Future” (“Programa tu futuro”) 
                sponsored by the governmental of Buenos Aires. My project, a mobile app to promote 
                the cultural event of the city, won the 2nd prize.
                <br><br>
                My other passions are my family, photography and the fight against 
                climate change. I started my own personal photography blog, Light, in 
                2019, to share the world through my eyes.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Thank you!</strong>
