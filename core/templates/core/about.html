            <p>Hello, my name is Ever, I'm 27 years old, I'm from Argentina and I live 
                in Rome, Italy. I'm a software student specialized in web development 
                with Django, a Python framework.
                <br><br>
                I started in computer science learning Java in mobile development and in a self-taught way to handle HML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
                <br><br>
                Once I finished this stage I decided to turn to web development with Python, which was a great success because it is a language very linked to my interests, such as web development or computer science. In short, I don't miss Java and I love Python.
                <br><br>
                Whenever I have time I train and study the latest technologies to bring the best possible practices.
                <br><br>
                I chose to develop in Django because it is a very powerful Python framework for complex web projects. Also to improve my experience and acquire more practice in the language.
                <br><br>
                Among my short term goals is to learn Docker and get better skills with JS.
                <br><br>
                Thank you very much for your time, a big hug!
